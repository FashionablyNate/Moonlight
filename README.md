# Moonlight

## Description:

A two-dimensional side-scrolling arcade-style game I designed and built called Moonlight. I chose to use the HaxeFlixel game engine along-side the Haxe programming language in order to execute this project. I designed it with the intention of providing an enjoyable gameplay experience and achieving a nostalgic retro style aesthetic. I used a multitude of skills to achieve my goals such as graphic design, physics, object oriented programming and animation.
